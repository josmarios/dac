Design/methodology/approach: The Graphical User Interface is the main mechanism of communication between user and system features. Educational software interfaces should provide useful features to assist learners without generate extra cognitive load. In this context, this research aims at analyzing a reduced and a complete interface of interactive geometry software, and verifies the educational benefits they provide. We investigated whether a reduced interface makes few cognitive demands of users in comparison to a complete interface. To this end, we designed the interfaces and carried out an experi- ment involving 69 undergraduate students. Findings: The experimental results indicate that an interface that hides advanced and extraneous fea- tures helps novice users to perform slightly better than novice users using a complete interface. After receiving proper training, however, a complete interface makes users more productive than a reduced interface. Originality/value: In educational software, successful user interface designs minimize the cognitive load on users; thereby users can direct their efforts to maximizing their understanding of the educational concepts being presented.","publisher":"Computers in Human Behavior","authors":["Simone S.

In order to promote this synergy, researchers on Affec-tive Computing discuss the importance of considering the affective states (emotion, mood and personality trait) in the creation of learning groups. However, there are few papers that study, classify and analyze the results obtained by the scientific community showing the real impacts of affective states in learning group. This paper presents the development of a systematic map-ping that investigates which and how affective states are considered in the learning group formation. In particular we intend to answer the research questions: (i) What are the affective states used in group formation in CSCL environment? (ii) Which techniques are used in group formation to (affective states) recognition, modeling and expression? (iii) Which pedagogical strategies are used to support the group formation with affective states in CSCL environment? (iv) What are the empirical results obtained using affective states in group formation? To con-duct this research nine digital databases were consulted. From 1081 analyzed papers, only 21 of them were selected with relevant information to help answer the research questions defined. As a major results, we highlight that: (i)76,19% of the studies considered the personality trait in CSCL environment group formation; (ii) most papers used affective state recognition in CSCL environment by questionnaires fill out by students; (iii)it was confirmed the lack of stud-ies which use pedagogical theories or strategies; and (iv) although 8 studies have been empiri-cally evaluated, it was observed that the obtained results by scientific community about affect in group formation in CSCL environments are still incipient, with several gaps and further research opportunities.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  Revista Brasileira de Informática na Educação \n \u003cmeta itemprop\u003d\"datePublished\" content\u003d\"2015-12\"\u003e 12/2015; 23(3):113-130.

Therefore, this work aims to conduct a Systematic Literature Mapping to identify the criteria to assess the quality of WES, and classify them according to their contribution. A total of 78 studies were analyzed, and we emphasized that: 37% are related to assessment of usability and user attitude, two important criteria in the quality verification; 34% address technical aspects such as reusability, flexibility and adaptability; and only 11% focus on social aspects such as software accessibility. Furthermore, we noticed the lack of criteria and mechanisms for quality assessment in Semantic WES indicating a research gap which can be explored in future work. We hope the results contribute to support the maintenance and improvement of the quality of courses and WES available to the community.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  DOI:\u0026nbsp;10.1109/ICALT.2015.88 Conference: Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT) 2015, At Hualien county, Taiwan \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["Aparecida Maria Zem-Lopes","Laís Zagatti Pedro","Seiji Isotani","Ig Ibert Bittencourt"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280239523_Desafios_no_uso_de_Dados_Abertos_Conectados_na_Educacao_Brasileira","title":"Desafios no uso de Dados Abertos Conectados na Educação Brasileira","abst":"ABSTRACT A quantidade de dados publicados na web tem crescido nos últimos anos.

On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has shown to be an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration sometimes decrease motivation of students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at Gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification in education is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. To help the adequate use of gamification in collaborative learning activities we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS in order to formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in CL situations. This paper will present the ontological structure to represent gamified CL scenarios and show the utility of our approach to define personalized conceptual models to gamify CL scenario based on students\u0027 needs and individual characteristics.","publisher":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","authors":["Geiser C.

Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL.","publisher":"Expert Systems with Applications","authors":["Diego Dermeval","Thyago Tenório","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Alan Silva","Seiji Isotani","Márcio Ribeiro"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272238071_Applications_of_ontologies_in_requirements_engineering_a_systematic_review_of_the_literature","title":"Applications of ontologies in requirements engineering: a systematic review of the literature","abst":"ABSTRACT There is an increase use of ontology-driven approaches to support requirements engineering (RE) activities , such as elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements.

The main findings of this review are: (1) there are empirical evidences to state that ontologies benefit RE activities in both academy and industry settings, helping to reduce ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness of requirements; (2) the vast majority of papers do not meet all RE phases; (3) nearly half of the papers use W3C recommended languages; (4) the majority of contributions are supported by a tool; and (5) there is a great diversity of requirements modeling styles supported by ontologies.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  DOI:\u0026nbsp;10.1109/SBES.2014.13 Conference: Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), At Maceió - Alagoas \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["Diego Dermeval","Jessyka Vilela","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Jaelson Castro","Seiji Isotani","Patrick Brito"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272154462_Desafios_na_Formacao_de_Professores_em_Informatica_na_Educacao_no_Brasil","title":"Desafios na Formação de Professores em Informática na Educação no Brasil","abst":"ABSTRACT Como agente organizador e facilitador da aprendizagem cabe ao professor incluir em suas práticas o uso das Tecnologias da Informação e Comunicação (TIC), mas isso tem ocorrido de forma tímida e incipiente.

To help students adequately acquire and develop their knowledge and skills, a teacher can plan a scenario that increases the probability for learning to occur. Such a scenario defines pedagogically sound structures that prevent off-task behavior and engage students in more meaningful interactions. The main difficulty in designing effective CL scenarios is transforming the teacher\u0027s intentions into elements that constitute the learning scenario. This problem is frequently observed when novice teachers attempt to improve the quality of learning and instruction by blending collaborative activities with individual activities without careful planning. With the goal of helping teachers in planning collaborative scenarios, we have developed an intelligent authoring tool referred to as CHOCOLATO using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. ontologies) in order to represent knowledge about different pedagogies and practices related to collaboration. Through the use of this knowledge, CHOCOLATO can provide intelligent guidance that helps teachers to create theory-based CL scenarios which has proven to be effective in a variety of situations. We evaluated it by conducting two experiments. We were interested in verifying whether the recommendations given by CHOCOLATO help novice teachers to design pedagogically sound CL activities, and if these activities help students to learn collaboratively in real classroom settings. The first experiment had the participation of 58 pre-service teachers that created CL scenarios with and without our authoring tool and the second experiment was carried out in a Brazilian public school together with 218 students. The results suggest that the guidance provided by CHOCOLATO do help novice teachers plan, understand and share CL scenarios more easily. They also suggest that the continuous utilization of well-designed theory-based CL activities create favorable conditions for students (particularly less knowledgeable ones) to improve their overall performance throughout the school year.","publisher":"Computers \u0026 Education","authors":["Seiji Isotani","Riichiro Mizoguchi","Sadao Isotani","Olimpio M.

Such scenarios, defined as Units of Learning (UoLs), comprise different components and are organized according to pedagogical approaches to orchestrate group learning processes. Examples of UoL components are learning objects, student roles, student characteristics (e.g., background, preferences, learning styles, etc.), instructional/learning goals, and activities, among others. Thus, the instructional design (ID) of a proper UoL for CSCL is a complex task that requires practice and experience. This is particularly true when designing, developing, adapting, and customizing UoLs, taking into consideration different instructional/learning goals and individual preferences of students. This paper therefore proposes using a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning approach to automate and optimize the tasks of designers. To accomplish that, we define an initial CSCL scenario as “an ID task” and “a set of information related to students and the domain to be taught.” Then we propose a model that formally describes ID for CSCL as HTN planning, where the initial CSCL scenario is adapted and refined according to student needs. In this model, the ID strategies are defined as hierarchical tasks and methods into a planning domain definition, and the initial CSCL scenario is defined as a planning problem definition. To validate our approach, we develop a CSCL courseware generator that (i) helps designers to set up an initial CSCL scenario; (ii) automatically generates a personalized UoL based on a given initial scenario; and (iii) supports the adaptation of UoLs.","publisher":"Expert Systems with Applications","authors":["Geiser Chalco Challco","Marco Aurélio Gerosa","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Seiji Isotani"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275771587_On_the_Use_of_Ontology_for_Dynamic_Reconfiguring_Software_Product_Line_Products","title":"On the Use of Ontology for Dynamic Reconfiguring Software Product Line Products","abst":"ABSTRACT Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. The traditional SPLs focus on building software platforms at development time. In contrast, modern systems of emerging domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, service robotics and autonomic systems) require new settings to perform dynamic reconfiguration. In this context, Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) extends the SPL concept to provide an efficient way to deal with software adaptation at runtime. A key artifact in SPL is the feature model. Such model is very important in the specification of SPLs, representing the variability of the software and also supporting the instantiation of applications. However, this model has some limitations regarding its usage in DSPL. In order to effectively provide dynamic reconfiguration of features, it is necessary to represent such model in a formal way thus it can be automatically monitored, retrieved and modified during the execution of a product. Hence, we propose an ontology for feature modeling, regarding its capabilities to handle changes in the feature models, demanding less effort to be reconfigurable at runtime. In order to illustrate the use of the ontology, a set of reconfiguration scenarios in the domain of ubiquitous computing are presented.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  Conference: International Conference on Software Engineering Advances (ICSEA), At Nice, France \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["THYAGO  TENÓRIO","DIEGO   DERMEVAL","I.

This growth is due to the fact that ontologies attempt to provide semantics to the data consumed by machines so that they can reason about this data. However, developing complex ontology-based applications is still difficult and time-consuming because the existing tools do not provide a simple and unified environment for developers. Most of these tools only provide data manipulation using RDF triples, complicating the development of applications that need to work with the object orientation paradigm. Furthermore, tools that provide instances manipulation via object orientation do not support features such as manipulating ontologies, reasoning over rules or querying data with SPARQL. In this context, this work proposes a framework and a tool for supporting the efficient development of ontology-based applications through the integration of existing technologies. Furthermore, we also define a methodology to use this tool efficiently. In order to evaluate the benefits of our work, a controlled experiment with eight developers (unfamiliar with ontologies) was performed to compare the proposed tool, JOINT, with another one, Jastor/Jena, frequently used by the community. The results suggest that our tool helps novice developers to create ontology-based applications faster and with few errors in the code. In addition, a real educational application with 10 ontologies, more than 200 ontology concepts (classes) and more than a million triples is already using the proposed tool successfully.","publisher":"Expert Systems with Applications","authors":["Olavo Holanda","Seiji Isotani","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Endhe Elias","Thyago Tenório"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257404466_Rule-based_expert_systems_to_support_step-by-step_guidance_in_algebraic_problem_solving_The_case_of_the_tutor_PAT2Math","title":"Rule-based expert systems to support step-by-step guidance in algebraic problem solving: The case of the tutor PAT2Math","abst":"ABSTRACT In order for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to correct students’ exercises, it must know how to solve the same type of problems that students do and the related knowledge components.

However, it has some drawbacks, such as an exponential complexity time, which impairs the desirable real-time response. In this paper we describe the expert system (ES) module of an Algebra ITS, called PAT2Math. The ES is responsible for correcting student steps and modeling student knowledge components during equations problem solving. Another important function of this module is to demonstrate to students how to solve a problem. In this paper, we focus mainly on the implementation of this module as a rule-based expert system. We also describe how we reduced the complexity of this module from O(nd) to O(d), where n is the number of rules in the knowledge base, by implementing some meta-rules that aim at inferring the operations students applied in order to produce a step. We evaluated our approach through a user study with forty-three seventh grade students.

In this paper, we consider existing proposals for architectural decisions documentation to define a template for recording the rationale of architectural design decisions. This template is based on a metamodel, which borrows concepts from the NFR Framework to express such rationale. Documenting decisions enables the evaluation of architectural design alternatives when requirements evolve or when new alternatives are devised. Moreover, the metamodel provides a relationship between requirements and architectural design fragments, facilitating the maintenance of traceability between the problem and the solution. We illustrate and discuss the use of this metamodel in the context of Acme architectural models and i* requirements models.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  DOI:\u0026nbsp;10.1145/2480362.2480601 Conference: Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["Diego Dermeval","Jaelson Castro","Carla Silva","João Pimentel","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Patrick Brito","Endhe Elias","Thyago Tenório","Alan Pedro"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270893531_Uma_Ferramenta_para_Monitorar_o_Processo_de_Escrita_Colaborativa_entre_Alunos_em_Sala_de_Aula","title":"Uma Ferramenta para Monitorar o Processo de Escrita Colaborativa entre Alunos em Sala de Aula","abst":"ABSTRACT Monitoring the writing process in a classroom is a very complex task.

The large number of students using such systems and their different knowledge and goals motivate the use of technologies to provide personalized activities, resources, and content to the students. Such environments are called adaptive educational systems. However, current efforts in this direction fail on providing external resources, content, or even interaction with peers. Therefore, systems are needed that interoperate, collaborate and exchange content or reuse functionality, in order to support a richer set of educational functions and increase their effectiveness. The semantic Web technologies have been proposed to ensure interoperability between Web applications to support such requirements. In this paper is proposed a semantic Web-based approach to provide interoperability between (concept/ontology-based) educational environments. It is also described a case study that illustrates the interoperation of educational environments through the use of shared ontologies/knowledge.","publisher":"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference","authors":["Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Evandro Costa","Lucas Braz","Henrique Pacheco","Darina Dicheva"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220711468_Modeling_JADE_Agents_from_GAIA_Methodology_under_the_Perspective_of_Semantic_Web","title":"Modeling JADE Agents from GAIA Methodology under the Perspective of Semantic Web","abst":"ABSTRACT Building multi-agent software systems is pointed out as a high complex task and researchers have raised different issues for building several applications. Therefore several AOSE methodologies and MAS frameworks have been proposed to facilitate the hard task of modeling and building high complex systems.

On the other hand, ontologies have been considered useful for representing the knowledge of software engineering techniques and methodologies in order to provide an unambiguous terminology that can be shared, reusable, and ensure the consistence between the concepts involved.

The final agreement is assumed to be satisfactory to both parts. To achieve effectively this goal, we modelled each player as a multi-agent system with its respective environment. In doing so, we aim at providing an effective means to collect relevant information to help agents to make good decisions, that is, how to choose the \"best way to play\" among a set of alternatives. Then we define a mechanism to model the opponent player and other mechanisms for monitoring relevant variables from the playerenvironment. Also, we maintain the context of the current game and keep the most relevant information of previous games. Additionally, we integrate all the information to be used in the refinement of the game strategies governing the multi-agent system.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e\n  Conference: ICEIS 2006 - Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems: Databases and Information Systems Integration, Paphos, Cyprus, May 23-27, 2006 \n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-source\"\u003e\n   Source: \n  \u003ca href\u003d\"http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iceis/iceis2006-4.html#OliveiraGSBC06\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003eDBLP\u003c/a\u003e \n \u003c/div\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["Rômulo Silva de Oliveira","Herman Gomes","Alan Silva","Ig Ibert Bittencourt","Evandro de Barros Costa"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220675825_An_Agent-Based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_A_Case_Study_in_Legal_Domain","title":"An Agent-Based Intelligent Tutoring System: A Case Study in Legal Domain.","abst":"ABSTRACT Computer based learning gets more and more im- portant in higher education.

Developing and maintain-ing Multi-agent ITS are a hard task since it involves different stakeholders, with different expert and roles, such as developers, for developing new software fea-tures; domain experts, for managing ITS knowledge domain; authors, for cus-tomizing ITS execution for a given context; and users, which are not aware about ITS complexity and require a friendly user interface to interact with the system. Some works have been proposed to support the development of ITS, but they do not consider the stakeholders involved in the whole development and maintenance processes. In this paper we present a framework for designing, de-veloping, and maintenance of Multi-agent ITS. This framework aims to be useful to ITS developers, domain experts, authors and users, providing a different view for each stakeholder, with different tools to support their activities. Indeed, it is introduced the first steps towards the framework architecture, design, and ex-tension points, detailing how to customize them for specific domains focusing mainly on developers. Finally, to illustrate our proposal approach a case study is presented.","publisher":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"pub-details js-pub-details\"\u003e \n \u003cdiv\u003e\n   Federal University of Campina Grande Rua Aprigio Veloso, 882 \n \u003c/div\u003e 58:109-900. \n\u003c/div\u003e","authors":["Ig Bittencourt","Evandro Costa","Hyggo Almeida","Baldoino Fonseca","Guilherme Maia","Ivo Calado","Alan Silva"]},{"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228698364_Towards_a_Reference_Model_to_Semantic_Web-based_Educational_Systems","title":"Towards a Reference Model to Semantic Web-based Educational Systems","abst":"ABSTRACT Semantic Web is one of the hottest research and development top-ics in recent years in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet community. Moreover, the same have happen to the AI and Education (AIED) community. Recently some initiatives to start so-called semantic web-based educational sys-tems (SWBES) have emerged in the AIED field. This is driven by the hope that the use of SW technologies in educational systems can help the accomplishment of AAAL: Anytime, Anywhere, Anybody Learning where most of the WWW re-sources are reusable learning objects supported by standard technologies and learning is facilitated by intelligent pedagogical agents. Although there are some initiatives to provide an architecture to SWBES, they do not describe all the roles and/or modules presents in a SWBES. This paper presents steps to-wards a reference model for semantic web-based educational systems. Resumo. Web Semântica tem sido considerada pela comunidade de In-teligência Artificial e da Internet como um dos grandes tópicos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento no ultimos anos. Além disso, o mesmo tem acontecido com a comunidade de Inteligência Artificial e Educa ao. Recentemente, algumas iniciativas para iniciar o que está sendo chamado de Sistemas Educacionais baseados na Web Semântica (SEWS) têm emergido no campo de Inteligência Artificial e Educa ao. Tais iniciativas são dirigidas pelo esperança de que tec-nologias da web semântica em sistemas educacionais possa ajudar a alcançar aprendizagem a qualquer momento, em qualquer lugar, para qualquer pes-soa, onde a grande parte dos recursos da WWW são objetos de aprendizagem reusáveis suportados por padrões tecnológicos e a aprendizage e facilitada por agentes pedagógicos inteligentes. Apesar de iniciativas para prover uma arquitetura para SEWS, eles não descrevem todos os papéis e/ou módulos pre-sentes em um SEWS.
